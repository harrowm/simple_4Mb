# simple_4Mb
A simple 4Mb RAM expansion card for the rosco sac.  Complicated only by the fact its mainly SMT ...

The boards are back from jlcpcb.  The only potential issue is that I put the vias for the capacitors on the pad.  This seems to have worked by default without the expensive via in pad process.  The connections between the pads and VCC/GND check out ok.

Running on the 68030 rosco works fine!
